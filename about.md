## Philosophy

I’ve learned that being a leader isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about creating an environment where your team can succeed and feel trusted to take on the tough problems. I believe in building teams that trust each other, focus on real impact, and are committed to making a difference. I approach my work with a deep sense of responsibility: if we're not solving real problems, we’re wasting everyone’s time. It’s that simple.

## Core Competencies

- **Strategic Vision & Execution:** I set the long-term course, but I’m also hands-on. I know how to lead and inspire teams to meet ambitious goals.
- **High-Performance Team Building:** I believe in hiring the right people, coaching them to succeed, and making sure they have everything they need to grow.
- **Agile & Lean Implementation:** I’m a big fan of lean processes that work, not just the trendy buzzwords. Efficiency is critical, but so is people’s time.
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Engineering isn't a silo. I've always led cross-functional teams and have worked with product, design, and marketing to deliver end-to-end solutions.
- **Innovative Problem-Solving:** I thrive on challenges that push me outside my comfort zone and force me to think outside the box. I’m not afraid to fail, as long as I learn from it.

## Track Record

- **Founder, Emerging Tech:** Started my own venture to help solve the ["loneliness epidemic"](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf)
- **Group Engineering Manager, Global Fintech:** Led engineering teams at scale in the fintech space
- **Software & R&D Manager, RegTech:** Specialized in the intersection of tech and regulatory challenges
- **Tech Lead, Logistics & Supply Chain:** Managed cross-functional teams to optimize supply chain systems
- **Senior Engineer, Healthcare & Research:** Built systems that impacted healthcare delivery and research outcomes

## Academic Training

- MS Cybersecurity, Georgia Institute of Technology
- BS Computer Engineering, Wright State University
