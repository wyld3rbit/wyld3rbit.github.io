# 10x Engineering Leader | e/acc Advocate

Scaled unicorns. Shipped moonshots. $1B-$5B impact. Accelerating the future.

I build rocket ships while they're flying. My teams turn "impossible" into "shipped it" before lunch. Firm believer in Effective Accelerationism (e/acc) - pushing tech boundaries to solve humanity's biggest challenges.

## What I do:

- Scale eng orgs from 20 to 500+ without breaking things (too much)
- Turn VC dollars into hockey-stick growth charts
- Make data scientists and product visionaries high-five
- Champion technological progress as the path to a better future

## Been there, done that:

- **Fintech:** Built a money-moving machine that handles $10B+/year
- **HealthTech:** Helped algorithms find cancer faster than humans
- **LogisticsTech:** Made atoms move like bits
- **RegTech:** Turned compliance from snooze-fest to competitive edge

## The cool stuff:

- Grew eng team 3x, cranked productivity 35%
- Slashed time-to-market 20% (DevOps magic)
- 5x'd compliance with AI (yeah, the robots are helping)
- Consistently pushed for adoption of cutting-edge tech to stay ahead

## Tech I geek out on:

- Distributed systems that scale to the moon
- Cloud-native everything (AWS, GCP, Azure? Yes.)
- ML/AI that actually solves real problems
- Blockchain (when it makes sense, not for hype)
- Zero-trust security (because paranoia is a feature)
- Any tech that accelerates human progress and potential

## How I lead:

- Inspire engineers to build stuff that matters
- Call BS on tech for tech's sake
- Cultivate 10x teams, not 10x individuals
- Diversity as a superpower, not a checkbox
- Embrace rapid iteration and calculated risk-taking

#### Domains of experience:

- [Senior Engineering Management](https://www.platohq.com/@arka-pattanayak-60671430)
- [Cybersecurity Policy](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/cybersecurity)
- [Fintech](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)
- [Bioinformatics](https://medicine.osu.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics)
- [Autonomous Systems](https://columbusstartupweek2016.sched.com/workmailap)

Always up for a whiteboard session on how to change the world with code. Let's grab a coffee and debate microservices vs. monoliths, why Rust is (or isn't) the future, or how we can accelerate technological progress responsibly.
